My name is Abhishek Sankar.

I graduated with a Master's in Robotics from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/overview/) in December 2024. I have a keen interest in SLAM, Robot Manipulation, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning, and I am passionate about exploring how these technologies can work together to create innovative solutions in the field of Robotics.
